# Rails Project: History of Events/People

## Description

This project is a rails api that hosts a database of posts about historical events and people made anonymously by users. However, users may comment on these posts, comments are not anonymous and are attached to each user's profile. In order to participate, a user needs to create an account by signing up. They will then be able to view their account, and how their account will be displayed to other users. Within the home tab, users can view all posts made by other users. User comments can also be updated and deleted by the user who created them.
